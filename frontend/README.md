# Symbalyze Frontend

This was created from the skeleton template by Android Studio. It will provide the user interface to interact with.

## Setting up in Android Studio Emulator (First Time Only)

- Make sure you have [Android Studio](<(https://start.ktor.io/p/routing-default)>) installed
- Make sure you have cloned this repository to your desired location on your machine
- Open Android Studio
- Click "Open"
- Find the location of the cloned repository
- Select either the build.gradle.kts or settings.gradle.kts file in frontend, then click OK (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
- On the bottom right, you will see a loading bar while Android Studio syncs and sets up (takes a while)
- Meanwhile, create a virtual device by going to "Device Manager" on the right sidebar (any configuration works)
- Once syncing finishes, click the "Run" triangle button at the top to start the app
- Go to "Running Devices" on the right sidebar to see the app homepage in the emulator
